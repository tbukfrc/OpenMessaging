# About

Hello! This is my latest project, OpenMessage. It's an open-source messenger written in Python (server) and JavaScript (browser). A CLI client is in the works.

I created this project to be as simple as possible to set up and use. Sending and recieving messages is handled via socket-io.

### Features:
* Instantly send and recieve messages
* Upload videos and images
* Create custom JS and CSS extensions and share them in chat
* Simple server config file
* Users can create a customizable amount of "rooms" (think discord channels), which can be locked with a password.
